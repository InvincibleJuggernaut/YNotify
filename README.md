# YNotify

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> This is a Flask based app that fetches the latest uploaded videos from the user's favorite YouTube channels and displays them in a gallery view. "Don't we have YouTube notifications for that?", you may ask. True. </p>
<p> A very small section of people don't like notifcation pings and rather prefer to keep them off. An even smaller section prefers to stay away from YouTube's sketchy recommendation algorithms.</p>
<p> This app provides an alternative to that by providing a glimpse at the latest uploads from your favorite artists/channels, all at one place. Ironically, it does make use of YouTube's API to search for the specific channel/user. The response is generated in JSON format. The uploads are presented in a gallery view using HTML templates and Flask.</p>
